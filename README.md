hello there! we're a system and here some info for you, since i'm pretty sure ppl from pony town are the ones reading this :
c+h only if its indicated! such as putting it in name.

some of us, might not want cosplayers from source to approach, we sometimes indicate that in name but other times not, so be careful. to be more specific, be careful near travis, andrew, ivan, skeet, b. spawn... yeah pretty much it! if youre gonna approach be EXTRA careful and, maybe make sure to ask with another pony thats not from their source if theyre okay with it!

now, we do not like ivandrew ships. do nor ship unless its some kind of, "oh everything went ok", "nothing bad happened" type of au, or if its before everything bad happened. cuddling and all with the ponies its ok, we like it. more if ure friend, pls do!

please, do not make axe jokes near our andrew. not at all.



**how do i know when its an alter whos fronting?**

well, unless you have our sp, you can tell by name, we put "sys" in the middle or start, so you can know better.

yes, we do have littles, they usually use the pony of a kiwi with an indicator that theyre a little, so yeah!

basically, make sure to read our names. ALWAYS make sure. i think thats all :)
